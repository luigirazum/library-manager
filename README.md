# library-manager
Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The Library Manager you'll create will allow you to:  Add new students or teachers. Add new books. Save records of who borrowed a given book and when. And all of this will be built in a beautiful, organized way.
